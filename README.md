# Stage1categorisation (testing)
Code to train various classifiers, aiming to optimise categorisation for the Higgs to diphoton analysis at Stage 1 of the Simplified Template Cross-section (STXS) framework.

## Setup
This is all desiged to run on the IC LX machines, in a CMSSW 10 environment.
Below are some instructions which should get you up and running.
Starting from a clean area:

```bash
cmsrel CMSSW_10_2_0
cd CMSSW_10_2_0/src/
cmsenv
git cms-init
git clone https://github.com/edjtscott/Stage1categorisation.git
```

If you don't have a github account yet, it's probably worth creating one and forking this repository so you can play with it and update as needed.
Once you do, then you'd add something like

```bash
git remote add yourusername https://github.com/yourusername/Stage1categorisation.git
git checkout -b yourbranchname
```

to create a new branch.
As you can see, there is currently just one directory, `TwoStep`.
It is so-called because the code there does the Stage 1 classification in two steps: assigning the signal bin first, then doing background discrimination.
Since doing both simultaneously in one classifier would also be possible, a `OneStep` directory might be handy at some point.
See the readme in `TwoStep` for explanations of what each script does.
